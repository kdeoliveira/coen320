### Real Time Application of Vehicule Monitoring System
This project involves all or part of the design, implementation, testing, and analysis of a simplified
real-time system for monitoring of vehicleâ€™s health conditions.

### Project

The application consist of two parts, a producer which gathers information a dataset
and a consumer that displays those information to the user
The project is built with CMake (producer) and qmake (consumer) and uses QNX SDP 7.0 and Qt 5.12.2 framework.
A toolchain file is provided so the code can be either compiled to any Unix system or cross-compiled to any supported QNX x64 system
Note that in order to built the GUI using GCC, the proper qmake tool needs to be generated from the Qt source files.
